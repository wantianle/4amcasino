# 4AM Casino

**Provably-fair Texas Hold'em for friend groups. Nobody sees a card they shouldn't — not even the server.**

Instead of trusting a server to deal, every player's browser takes part in a
[mental poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_poker) protocol: the deck is encoded as
points on the ristretto255 curve, each player masks and shuffles it with a secret per-hand key,
and every card is opened only by the cooperation of all players. The server coordinates
messages and enforces betting rules, but it never holds a masking key and never learns a hole
card.

Chips are play money. Players buy points from a **bank**; the room's **banker** approves each
purchase, and every chip movement — buys, pots, bounties, transfers — lands in an append-only,
**hash-chained ledger** the whole room can verify, so the group settles up outside the app.
No real payments, ever.

## What's inside

**The game.** No-limit Hold'em on a round isometric table where seats arrange themselves
live and yours is always bottom-center. A turn timer the banker picks (15s to no-limit),
one-tap quick bets and pre-selected actions so you never stall the table, a blinking
can't-miss-it highlight on whoever's turn it is, chip stacks that slide to the pot and sweep
in at street end, board cards that flip over back-to-face with a cascading flop, big
draggable hole cards, auto-deal when the banker is online, winner-reveal choreography with
plain-English reasoning for why the hand won, full hand replays rebuilt from the signed game
record, sit-out, four card-back colorways and a 4-color deck option, on a permanently dark
theme.

**The people.** Friends with live presence, table invites (with an opt-in auto-join), public
tables listed in every lobby or private 6-letter codes, watch-only spectator links where
viewers can ask to join and the banker admits them, an attached Meet/Zoom link per table,
voice chat, table chat with your own quick phrases, and reactions.

**The money.** A banker (plus an optional co-banker) approves buy-ins; every movement is
hash-chained. Players can send or lend chips to each other between hands. The banker can revert
a purchase, void a single hand, or void a whole table — voided amounts drop out of everyone's
totals automatically. Rooms can require a minimum number of hands before someone's winnings
count in settle-up. The ledger page renders a full session report: time played, hands, biggest
pot, per-player win/loss bars, and who owes whom.

**The bragging rights.** Global and in-room leaderboards with a chip-leader crown, a cumulative
winnings chart in the lobby, a play-style radar mined from your actual hand transcripts
(loose/aggressive/pressure/showdowns/wins, plus an archetype: shark, rock, maniac, calling
station...), one-tap shareable hand-result images, an optional 7-2 offsuit bounty the banker
can put up, paid peeks at mucked cards (if the owner agrees), and a private mode that hides
your winnings from everyone but the bankers.

**The robots.** [`apps/mcp`](apps/mcp/README.md) ships an MCP server that gives any
MCP-capable agent (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, ...) a real seat: join by code, buy chips,
read the table, act. The headless client runs all the cryptography, so the same fairness
guarantees hold for bots — nobody, not even the server, sees the agent's cards.

## How the cards stay secret

The live app walks through this with animations at
[4amcasino.com/fair](https://4amcasino.com/fair). The short version:

- **Shuffle**: each hand, every player in turn multiplies all 52 card points by a secret key
  and permutes them. After all players have gone, the deck's order is unknown to everyone.
- **Key commitments + DLEQ proofs**: each player publishes a commitment to their hand key, and
  every unmask they ever send carries a Chaum–Pedersen proof it used exactly that key. A wrong
  share is rejected and attributed the moment it arrives — and a showdown reveal cannot claim a
  different card than the one dealt.
- **Dealing**: to give you a hole card, all *other* players apply their proven unmasks; you
  apply yours last, locally. Observers see a point still masked by your key.
- **Transcripts**: every protocol message is signed (ed25519) and folded into a hash chain.
  Completed hands are stored and downloadable for offline audit. Rooms can opt into
  `strict-audit` mode, where everyone reveals their hand key after each hand so the entire
  shuffle can be re-verified (at the cost of folded cards becoming public afterwards).
- **Honest about limits**: a malicious *shuffle* is detected and attributed (at open time or on
  key reveal), not cryptographically prevented — that trade keeps the protocol simple enough
  for a friends game. And when you fold, your client escrows your per-hand key with the server
  so the hand survives you closing the tab (the server can then compute your unmask shares,
  with proofs everyone can verify) — meaning the server *can* see a folder's own two cards
  after the fold, and nobody else's. Out-of-band collusion (screen sharing) is out of scope, as it is for
  every protocol. See [`docs/superpowers/specs/`](docs/superpowers/specs/) for the full design
  and threat model.

Your password never leaves the browser either: the client derives a login key and a separate
ed25519 signing identity from it with domain-separated scrypt, so the server can authenticate
you but can never sign or decrypt as you.

## Running it

Requires Node 22+.

```bash
npm install

# development (two terminals)
npm run dev --workspace @4am/server   # API + WebSocket on :8787
npm run dev --workspace @4am/web      # Vite dev server on :5173 (proxies to :8787)

# self-host (one process serves everything)
npm run build --workspace @4am/web    # builds the app AND a prebundled server
npm run start --workspace @4am/server # serves the built app + API + WS on :8787
```

State lives in a single SQLite file (`DB_PATH`, default `./4amcasino.db`). Set `PORT` to change
the port. Create an account, create a room, share the 6-letter code, buy points, and deal.

## Hosting

The app is one long-running Node process (HTTP + WebSocket + a SQLite file), so it needs a
host that runs real servers — serverless platforms (Vercel/Netlify functions, GitHub Pages)
can't run it.

**Render:** this repo ships a [`render.yaml`](render.yaml) blueprint. In the Render dashboard
choose **New → Blueprint**, pick this repository, and deploy. On the free tier the service
sleeps after ~15 min idle and storage is ephemeral (the ledger resets on every deploy); the
`starter` plan with the 1 GB disk block gives a persistent ledger, which is how
[4amcasino.com](https://4amcasino.com) runs. The server also supports an optional
MongoDB snapshot layer (`MONGO_URL`) that continuously backs up and restores the database.

The primary domain is `4amcasino.com`. Requests to `poker.notpritam.in` receive
a permanent 308 redirect with their path and query preserved. Keep the old
domain's DNS and Render custom-domain entry in place so these redirects and
its HTTPS certificate keep working. Existing MCP configurations should use
`FOURAM_URL=https://4amcasino.com` to send authenticated requests directly.

**Docker (any VPS, Fly.io, Railway):**

```bash
docker build -t 4amcasino .
docker run -p 8787:8787 -v 4amcasino-data:/data 4amcasino
```

**Quick game night without hosting at all:** run it locally (`npm run start --workspace
@4am/server`) and share a tunnel, e.g. `npx ngrok http 8787` or a
[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) address. Friends on the same Wi-Fi can just open
`http://<your-LAN-IP>:8787`.

## Platform administration

The platform account opens the dedicated dashboard at `https://admin.4amcasino.com`.
The same dashboard is available at `https://4amcasino.com/admin` while the subdomain
is being connected. Sign in separately on the admin hostname with the existing
platform account; ordinary player accounts cannot access its data or controls.

**Platform settings → House cut** changes the rate without a redeploy. The initial
rate is 0.5%. Choose **All rooms** to change future hands in existing rooms too, or
**New rooms only** to leave existing room rates alone. The editor records who made
each change and prevents a stale browser tab from overwriting a newer setting.
Completed and running hands keep their original rates. Settings and history are
included in the existing database snapshots. Room qualification requirements are
limited to 0–30 hands; older requirements above 30 are reduced automatically.

The dashboard also includes revenue, user dues, a searchable account directory,
room management, and pending requests. Amounts are chips; recorded payments are
user-reported, so receipt must still be confirmed separately.

To connect the admin subdomain on the existing Render service:

1. In Cloudflare, add a **CNAME** record named `admin`, targeting
   `fouramcasino.onrender.com`, with **DNS only** enabled.
2. In Render → service → Settings → Custom Domains, add `admin.4amcasino.com`.
3. Wait for Render to verify DNS and issue its certificate, then check the URL.

The app already accepts the admin origin and routes its root to administration.
No second service or database is needed.

## Repository layout

```
packages/shared        cards, hand evaluator, betting engine, WS message schemas
packages/mental-poker  the crypto: group ops, shuffle/unmask, DLEQ proofs, transcripts
apps/server            Fastify + ws + SQLite: auth, rooms, bank/ledger, hand orchestration
apps/web               React (Feature-Sliced Design) + Tailwind v4 client, dark theme
apps/mcp               MCP server + headless client: an AI seat at the table
docs/                  design spec, implementation plans, screenshots, UI reference
```

`npm test` runs the whole suite (100+ tests), including an end-to-end test where simulated
clients play complete hands over WebSocket with the real cryptography, and one where an MCP
headless client sits at the table.
