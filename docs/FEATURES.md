# Feature credits

Every feature in 4AM Casino carries the name of the person who asked for it. When you ship a
feature, add a row here and mention the requester in the code comment nearest the feature's
core (see `/api/rooms/:id/hands` for the pattern).

| Feature | Requested by |
| --- | --- |
| Freezeout tournaments: entry fee is your stack, one entry with no re-entry, zero chips ends your run, play to a single survivor who keeps every chip, commission-funded bonus pool paid 50/30/20, and a capped sit-out budget that still posts blinds so nobody can wait out the field | **notpritam** |
| Per-hand personal results: your net for every hand, where you folded, showdown outcome, paid-to-fold total | **siwans** |
| Live ahead-of-turn actions: options track the table, Call arms at a price and disarms if raised | **notpritam** |
| Round table: seats positioned live around an isometric oval, your seat pinned at the bottom | **notpritam** |
| Banker sees every seat and can stand a player up (two-tap kick) | **notpritam** |
| Banker badge on seats, docked side chat, fullscreen toggle, controls merged onto the table | **notpritam** |
| Leaderboard rank (#1, #2, #3...) on player profiles; profile header merged for space | **notpritam** |
| Chip physics: bets slide chip stacks to the pot, sweep in at street end, pot pulses; chip-slide and pot-collect sounds | **notpritam** |
| Winner reveal: a gold WIN tag with the amount rides the winning seat's card, chips fly from the pot, and the winner's stack value reveals; larger table oval | **notpritam** |
| Text diet: icon labels, terse status lines; control strip moved below the table | **notpritam** |
| Blinking turn highlight: breathing glow, PLAYING pill, scale-up on the to-act seat | **notpritam** |
| Real chip stacks: denominations colored by tier off the big blind, isometric piles that grow with bets and the pot | **notpritam** |
| Pending buys shown at the seat (+N soon until the banker approves); seated / in-hand player counts in the header | **notpritam** |
| Auto-organised seating: only occupied seats, evenly spread; unseated members see + spots in the gaps | **notpritam** |
| Controls never hide mid-hand: Fold / Call / Raise stay in place off-turn and arm as pre-actions | **notpritam** |
| Mid-hand kick: the banker can stand anyone up any time; it means auto-kicked from the next deal | **notpritam** |
| Raise highlight: amber glowing badge that pops on the raiser seat; quiet chips for calls, bold ALL-IN | **notpritam** |
| Card reveal choreography: board cards flip back-to-face with a cascading flop, in 2D | **notpritam** |
| New-design landing page (round isometric table preview) and README refresh with fresh screenshots | **notpritam** |
| TV replays: banker toggle that saves every player's hand key post-hand; the server decrypts folded hole cards into the transcript and replays show ALL cards from the deal, WSOP broadcast style | **notpritam** |
| Save hand: download the full signed hand record (transcript + players) as JSON from the replay page | **notpritam** |
| Ready check: auto-deal never starts betting until everyone clicks "I'm ready"; a short 1.5s window (it ends the instant everyone is in), then it deals without the stragglers | **notpritam** |
| Room auto-deal switch on the table; prefers the online, seated host, automatically chooses a funded online fallback, preserves readiness, and pauses when too few players are ready | **notpritam** |
| Misclick guard: Fold / Check-Call / Raise hold fixed positions in every state and go dead for a beat whenever the options change | **notpritam** |
| Custom poker shortcuts: account-saved Fold, Check, Call, Bet/Raise, half-pot, pot, and all-in bindings; record, select, clear, disable, or restore in Settings or at the table. Shared keyboard handling across desktop and phone; typed amount plus Enter confirms sizing shortcuts | **notpritam** |
| Run it twice: when everyone is all-in before the river the players vote (unanimous; each of the two stages - the behind player's run-count choice, then the ahead player's agreement - gets its own 7.5s, so a valid-but-slow negotiation can take up to 15s total); the remaining streets deal twice from the untouched deck and every pot splits between the boards | **notpritam** |
| Showdown shows every player who reaches showdown: the result banner lists each showdown player with THEIR two cards, the hand they made, and their net - not just the winning five. Folded players appear only if they voluntarily show their cards | **notpritam** |
| Thunder reveal: lightning flash + thunder crack on every showdown | **notpritam** |
| The table cards in the result banner, next to the winning five | **notpritam** |
| Dealer button: a bold gold D disc on the felt marks the button and stays with the seat all hand (no SB/BB badges) | **notpritam** |
| Fold-key escrow: a folding client hands its per-hand key to the server (only the server, never the transcript), so a folder who leaves can never strand the hand - the server computes their unmask shares with publicly verifiable DLEQ proofs (`recovered_share`). Tradeoff: after your fold the server can decrypt your two cards, nobody else's | **notpritam** |
| Last-hand strip: a collapsible recap at the bottom of the table - previous hand's winner, board, everyone's revealed cards and nets, one click to open or cut out (remembered), with a jump to the full replay | **notpritam** |
| Platform commission, mandatory and automatic: 0.5% initial rate for all rooms, editable by the platform account at runtime for all rooms or new rooms only (floored per pot; running hands and historical dues keep their original rate) to the platform account on the ledger (auto-seeded/adopted on boot; falls back to the banker only if unseeded) - the donation that keeps the platform running; shown in the result banner as "to the house" | **notpritam** |
| Platform dues: searchable per-user outstanding commission, accrued charges, recorded payments, and room breakdowns in Admin, the platform profile, and Settle up; players see their own amount in profile stats and settlement. Whole-chip allocation is shared across all views | **notpritam** |
| Leavers stop stalling: a player who leaves before betting starts aborts the deal in ~4s and the redeal skips them; the ready check drops leavers instantly instead of waiting out their deadline | **notpritam** |
| Profile settle-up: your own profile lists who you owe and who owes you, per room, to conclude the game; both sides mark "settled" and the debt resolves on the platform too | **notpritam** |
| Add friend + send points from any player's profile: befriend them and move points through any room you share, straight from their page | **notpritam** |
| Linear-style profile: full-width three-column layout (identity left, money and game middle, history right), settle-up grouped per room and collapsible with the bottom line in the header, URL-backed tabs | **notpritam** |
| Hand history with your cards: the profile's transaction wall compressed into per-hand rows - outcome, YOUR hole cards, net - expandable to the board and a replay link; raw money moves on their own tab | **notpritam** |
| Wider screens everywhere: hands, ledger, leaderboard, and replay pages stop hugging a skinny center column | **notpritam** |
| Full-screen lobby and pages: lobby goes three-column (actions / game + rooms / friends), the ledger splits report-beside-table, hands and leaderboard become card grids on big monitors | **notpritam** |
| Best hand showcase: a player's biggest win as a snapshot on their profile - their cards, the board, the amount, one click to the replay - reachable from the leaderboard's "best +N"; the owner can hide it | **notpritam** |
| BB-style app shell: a persistent icon-led left sidebar - nav, your rooms as a thread list with active highlight, settings/theme/GitHub/account at the bottom - collapsible to an icon rail; mobile keeps the drawer | **notpritam** |
| Player-wise settle-up (primary): one combined line per person across every room, expandable to the per-room breakdown; the by-room view stays one toggle away | **notpritam** |
| Hands that tell the story: "won with a Flush" titles, and each history row expands to who you beat and what THEY held; win/lost/folded/showdown filters ride the URL on both the profile rail and the hands page | **notpritam** |
| Replay to GIF: one button renders the whole hand as an animated GIF (board, actions, reveals, winnings), downloads it, and opens a ready tweet - brag on Twitter in two clicks | **notpritam** |
| Settings as a real page: sticky section rail (Profile / Table & play / Account & security / Session), titled cards, a save bar that follows you down the page | **notpritam** |
| Edit your password and your username - both re-derive your card-signing key in the browser, upload the new pubkey, and sign out every other device | **notpritam** |
| Forgotten-password recovery: a one-time 120-bit recovery code you arm in settings and redeem on the login page; single-use, burns every session, constant-time so it never reveals whether an account exists | **notpritam** |
| Shareable table links: copy the code, copy a `/j/CODE` link, or hand it to the OS share sheet - a logged-out friend opens it, signs up, and lands in the room automatically | **notpritam** |
| The sidebar reaches the table too, but every link there opens in a new tab - you can check the ledger or your stats without walking away from a live hand | **notpritam** |
| Settle up in one place: every room netted to one line per person, payment redirects that let a debt owed to you pay off a debt you owe (so the money never passes through your hands), house dues showing your share of the actual rake with a way to record paying it, remarks and a photo of the transfer from BOTH sides before a debt clears, and a nudge for anything waiting on you | **notpritam** |
| Member numbers: every account records the order it joined the platform (#1, #2, #3...), shown on the profile as "member #7 of 42" with a star for the first ten - kept as its own column so a gap in the row ids never changes what it means | **notpritam** |
| Line-by-line security audit (four parallel subagents over auth, the economy, the game protocol, and the client) and the fix pass that followed: chip-amount caps that close an integer-overflow money faucet, client-side refusal of unmask/key requests the protocol never authorises, WebSocket frame and rate limits, session expiry and a real logout, CSP and an origin allowlist, private mode honoured on profiles, and a settle-up netting bug that cancelled real debts | **notpritam** |
| Everything before 2026-08-24 (mental poker core, ledger and banking, friends and spectating, cyberpunk theme, MCP seat, fairness tour, auto-approve buys, ...) | **notpritam** |
| Auto ready: a profile toggle that counts you as ready the moment a ready check opens, held server-side so it works with the tab in the background; if everyone at the table has it on the check is skipped entirely | **notpritam** |
| **房间生命周期：** 房主可立即关闭房间；平台可直接归档或恢复房间。两者都会停止新牌局、清空座位并保留完整历史与未结债务。房主关闭不需要平台审批；只有平台可以恢复已关闭/归档房间。平台归档要求当前没有进行中的牌局。Host 离线交接只转移 host，不自动转移 banker。 | **notpritam** |
| Host badge on the seat, next to the banker's, and the host role moves to someone still at the table after 60s offline - the banker never moves on a timer | **notpritam** |
| Room standings: a Standings button opens a dialog of who is up and who is down, refreshing at the end of every hand while it is open | **notpritam** |
| Dedicated Zeus administration workspace at admin.4amcasino.com, with /admin fallback: overview, daily commission chart, searchable users, room controls, requests, dues, and audited commission settings | **notpritam** |
| Qualification requirements capped at 30 hands, including migration of older rooms above that limit; hosts may choose fewer hands or zero | **notpritam** |
